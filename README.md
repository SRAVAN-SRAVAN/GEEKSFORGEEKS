The explosive population growth and health maintenance is an extremely crucial matter worldwide. 
Many lethal diseases are causing threats at a high peak in recent years. 
Introducing machine learning technologies into healthcare for early prognosis and diagnosis need to be more accurate based on the parameters and frames selected from the available clinical databases. 
Healthcare domain is a very prominent research field with rapid technological advancement and increasing data day by day.
The diabetes is one of lethal diseases in the world. 
It is additional a inventor of various varieties of disorders for example: coronary failure, blindness, urinary organ diseases etc. 
In such case the patient is required to visit a diagnostic center, to get their reports after consultation.
But with the growth of Machine Learning methods we have got the flexibility to search out an answer to the current issue, we have got advanced system mistreatment information processing that has the ability to forecast whether the patient has polygenic illness or not. 
The exploration inferred that more variables and hybrid disciplines should be considered for an accuracy of result which can overcome the existing limitations.
The existing diagnosis systems have some drawbacks , such as high computation time , and low prediction accuracy.
To handle this issue, we have proposed a IOT based diagnosis system using machine learning to detect and classify the presence of diabetes disease in e- health care environment.
For implementation we taken random forest classifier into account and we implemented this program in jupyter software.
